# Browser Load Page
Browser Load Page is a custom landing page for my Chrome Browser.

# More About the Project
This project is made to customize the landing page for my browser. 
The purpose is to have a page that houses various important information such as current time, weather info, location, etc. 
I have set it to be the default page that Chrome loads to, as well as my dedicated homepage in browser.
Backgrounds are also changing depending on the time of day.

# Access
My version of the project is live at https://jackbisceglia.github.io/browserLoadPage/
To use this yourself, the skeleton can be preserved. Just fork the repo, input your own DarkSky API key (mine is obviously available publicly but please do not use it. The only thing that will happen if you make use of my key is that the program's weather functionality will break due to too many requests. No fiscal consequences). After forking the repo, clone it and customize the name at the top. You can add in your own quotes to the JSON file in the repo if you would like as well.

Enjoy!
